At the start of my tech career I had consumed a lot of books, documentaries, and videos on the success stories of American tech companies. Being very young with no experience and little thought of how the real world works, it was very easy to assume you could do be the next guy creating a company that grows into billions of dollars. Being inspired and motivated for such a big goal was so effortless and simple. That is, until you grow a little more, you find out it’s not very much so easy as you thought. I don’t want to say that your dreams die, but you slowly realize they possibly will stay as dreams.

On the other hand, the motivation can sometime kick in and remind you of what you dreamt when you were more naive. At this point you might’ve revised your big goals. I was a very big fan of Elon Musk (I currently hold different opinions). Even though it was somewhat impossible for me to take a path on which I end up creating a successful rocket company, it was a feel-good kind of dream. More of a fantasy maybe. Nonetheless, I’m glad I had such dreams and I respect anyone who did the same even if it’s impossible to become real.

Years in, you look out for opportunities to achieve something of your own and be free, instead of staying as a cog in the machine. Being a cog in the machine is not necessarily bad. At the end of the day, those “dreamers” need other people tho help them achieve their goals. If everyone became a startup founder, that would not be efficient I guess. Startups and companies need users. Otherwise what’s the point of it?

Where I stand at now is also making me excited, again. I regained my “purpose” and “motivation”. In part, thanks to the indie makers I got to know online. It was very interesting to discover this sub/niche of startups and how they work. If you know the indie maker circles, you might’ve come to notice how (most of them) they’re inclined to call anything they make as a startup. You’ll occasionally see an indie maker say “I have built 35 startups”, which sounds pretty over-proud. For me, I always defined a startup as something classic out of Silicon Valley, with the typical [insert name] University alumni founders, rushing to develop their idea and get investment as fast as possible.

I personally feel more inclined to follow the path of indie makers, rather than aim to create a startup and become a unicorn. I like the idea of doing my own thing with my own terms and not having to deal with VCs and investments and other stuff that comes with it. I like to be free. I don’t find myself capable, or at least, willing to be the person having to make deals, pursue other people, bring resources, take loans, etc. If I had to do that when the day comes, I would at least try to do my best, of course.

To kick off my journey, I refurbished a little fun project I did three years ago and decided to release it do an audience. With very low expectations, did my preps and launched it on Product Hunt. Got a total of 5 upvotes at the end of the day. Thanks to keeping them low, I didn’t allow that to crush my feelings. At the end of the day, a little fun thing was open to the world.

I feel like I derailed while writing up to this point, but I also wanted to mention a few things that I find interesting in the indie makers community. Especially on X (formerly Twitter). Many of the known people there have the quite attention-grabbing type of personas. You can see how much is in their bank account, and how much they make per month (MRRs) and how luxury their lives got thanks to their “startups”.

I do realize that this is the internet, all types of people do different things. But I’d like to focus a bit on this community since that’s what I’m interested at. I feel that there’s too much emphasize on displaying money and status in a way that they’re trying to fill a hole in their egos, or try to get younger and more desperate people envy and praise them. I find that very poisoning.

I also came across something interesting. While browsing, I found one of those boilerplate SaaS “startups”. If you land on their website, you’d quickly think “Wow! This product must be making a lot of money!” because of the banner messages that popped up every minute saying “A user in Romania has purchased a subscription for $49”. I was curious enough to inspect the network and refresh the page to see how this thing works. Turns out, they were using hardcoded messages to show up at an interval. User deceiving much?

While at that, I clicked the link for this popup service and got to their website. The headline reads as “turn visitors into customers”. But I thought to myself, how is it ethical to lie to your visitors to get them buy your product with false notifications? Pretty obviously, not everyone would look in the network tab or question the authenticity of these “someone bought our product” notifications.

Besides this, you could also see some known people in the testimonials of these two products I mentioned. I really questioned myself whether I missed the point about the whole thing, but really can’t see a way this makes it acceptable. I would’ve expected to see that at least someone pointed to this deceiving practice. I’d appreciate if someone reading this post could explain how this is ok.

If you spent some more time getting to know these circles, you will have seen the copycats too. The people that try to imitate those who “made it”, copying their work, their styles, even their profile photos. Like, are you people trying to create a cult or what? Isn’t the whole point with “startup-ing” is to create something of your own? Or at least, something similar to what already exists but with your flavor?

Comments on Product Hunt launches also mostly seem to be written just for the sake of being written. To get noticed, maybe to get a follow as a thank you. Not much of them care about what’s actually shared. Soulless engagement is put ahead of authentic connections almost everywhere. I still do hesitate whether I should have a presence for this very reason. It’s difficult to get noticed among thousand others and people do foolish things to attract attention, to be on the spotlight.

But it’s not all bad. I got to know to some amazing people (not just among indies) who are working very hard, are honest and authentic, and whose work inspire me in the best way. This is why I find it worthy of being online regardless of everything I seem to have complained about. Getting to know them helped me get rid of the idea that it’s not worth it or that I shouldn’t try, and taught me that it’s possible to make money without being an obnoxious idiot.

Some people invoke bitter feelings with their personas, and some spread appreciation, wholesomeness, and inspiration with their work.
