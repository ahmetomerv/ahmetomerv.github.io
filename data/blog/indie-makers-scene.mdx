Until a few months, I wasn’t really so familiar with the indie maker/solopreneur circles in the internet. I’ve been following lots of people in tech for years, but these folks do things a bit differently. Different in the sense that they have some unique styles on how they use their social media accounts. More on that later.

Two or three years ago I had started doing a little project for fun. After finishing the first working version I released it on a platform which recently ditched their free plans so it meant that I needed to deploy it somewhere else. So I decided to get a server and do it myself, and maybe in the process learn some basic DevOps myself. I refurbished my app so that it can actually be used, and looked for ways to “release” it to an audience.

At some point I had already been acquainted with the likes of (**@levelsio).** Occasionally I’d see a few tweets on how their “startups” are doing XXX MRR, and of that sort. It’s pretty interesting to see how things worked out for some people. It gives you the idea that “you can actually do that too”. 

I always had dreamed of doing something of my own, but also felt that motivation is not there, and that my ideas were just “crap”.  When I was younger (I’m not even 30 by the way) I dreamt of even bigger things. Like starting a rocket company. Elon Musk was some kind of a hero for me at the time, although now I feel different. But that’s not the point. My mindset switched from “I want to start a rocket company” to “my ideas are crap, I don’t have motivation”.  Now that I think of this, both are unrealistic. Both aren’t the right way to move forward.

Being exposed to the indie-maker and solopreneur networks changed my perception. It made me feel that I could do or try something without having a real big deal. This was when I felt that I could revive my “dreams” that were laying low for some years. It’s part of self-actualization and it never dies out.

I released this small-fun project I mentioned earlier on Product Hunt, with a total of 5 upvotes in the launch day. I wasn’t actually expecting to be on the 1st rank with something that was built just for fun. My expectation was already low so it didn’t crush my feelings. It was okay.

Coming to the point of this writing: I don’t understand how people are fine with the way they’re portraying themselves on social media. Specifically, in the indie-maker networks.

What I mean is, the constant posts of “I made this much money”, “my MRR is this much”, or the advice posts that look like they’re trying to help or motivate people but beneath it’s actually just seeking for validation and praise. I don’t think these are bad values inherently. I do have them too to a certain degree. But I just don’t believe that we (or I) should reflect it in a way that comes off as obnoxious and needy. There’s a fine line (there’s always one). There are healthier ways of doing that.

If you’ve been on social media, specifically in the indie makers circles, for a while, you know the top people in the field. And if you spent some more time, you will have seen the copycats. The people that try to imitate the same work, the same style, even the same profile photos of those who got relative success. It’s awkward.

Comments on Product Hunt launches seem to be written just for the sake of being written. Not much of them care about what’s actually shared. Soulless engagement is put ahead of authentic connections. X is filled with accounts that share “20 AI tools you need to start using” threads.

What I find more annoying is how some people find it “right” to do certain things to achieve their goals. I recently came across a boilerplate SasS product which was outright deceiving users by banners on their landing page. “New user subscribed! $49.99 Annual Plan” message shows on the top-right but it’s actually one of the hardcoded messages that was programmed to show every 60 seconds. Seems pretty unethical but somehow it was thought of and got implemented.

But the thing is, I didn’t find anyone discuss this deceiving practice. It may look like I care about this like it’s the only issue in the world, but in a relatively small context it is kind of a deal. It’s not a huge network. Some of the top people in the field even have endorsements/testimonials on this product, so I thought they might’ve noticed. Didn’t seem like it.

I still do hesitate whether I should have a presence for this very reason. It’s difficult to get noticed among thousand others and people do foolish things to attract attention, to be on the spotlight. Farming engagement, deceiving users, and showing off just for social media numbers.

But it’s not all bad. I got to know to some amazing people who are working very hard, are honest and authentic, and whose work inspire me in the best way. This is why I find it worthy of being online regardless of everything I seem to have complained about.
